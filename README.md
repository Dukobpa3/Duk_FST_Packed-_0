# Reskin XBOXSX Ext theme for Playnite

First of all read the [original theme description](https://github.com/TheKersalMassive/ReskinXBOXSX)
For now everything described there -- working also in this theme.
Both can be installed at the same time.

# The main Idea of theme
I like the simple style of the original Reskin XBOXSX Theme, so for now won't change it but who knows :)
Focused on comfort gaming with GamePad and GFE.
Also have couple hundreds games on different markets and installed just about 20% of them so wanted to see some additional game details to choose what install/play next.
Also playing with 8-eight kid so important to see AgeRatings also.
Also very lazy so if I don't have needed metadata or can't automate it - I will not add it to theme.

Future plans
- couple more game details on the Details page
- and maybe in the games list
- waiting for inspiration :)

For now very recommended to install LibraryManagement plugin + ExtraMetadataLoader plugin.
(Because if not - so why do you need this theme? :) )
